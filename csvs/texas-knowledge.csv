120.20.d,Cross-curricular English language acquisition student expectations.,"01, 02, 03, KG",120
120.20.e,Proficiency level descriptors.,"01, 02, 03, KG",120
120.20.c.1,"The English language proficiency standards (ELPS) outline student expectations and proficiency level descriptors for EB students in English. The ELPS are organized across four language domains: listening, speaking, reading, and writing.","01, 02, 03, KG",120
120.20.c.2,"Language acquisition is a complex process that consists of several interrelated components, including phonetics, phonology, semantics, syntax, morphology, and pragmatics. As students develop proficiency in these language structures, they are able to make connections between their primary language and English.","01, 02, 03, KG",120
120.20.c.3,"Classroom contexts foster social and academic registers, which are types of language appropriate for a situation or setting, to support language proficiency. Informal (social) language consists of English needed for students to effectively interact, exchange ideas, and engage in various settings and contexts. Formal (academic) language consists of oral and written language used to build knowledge, participate in content-specific discourse, and process complex academic material found in formal school settings and interactions.","01, 02, 03, KG",120
120.20.c.4,"The progression of skills in the four language domains are developed simultaneously and can be divided into two categories: receptive skills and expressive skills. Listening and reading are the receptive (input) skills. Students' development in receptive skills is necessary for comprehension and attainment of the English language and content. Speaking and writing are the expressive (output) skills. Students' ability to express and share their personal ideas and content knowledge allow teachers the opportunity to check for understanding and adjust instruction. Effective content-based language instruction involves engaging EB students in scaffolded opportunities to listen, speak, read, and write at their current levels of proficiency while gradually increasing linguistic complexity.","01, 02, 03, KG",120
120.20.c.5,"In order for EB students to be successful, educators must create an environment that welcomes and encourages students to leverage their unique cultural and linguistic experiences as they develop English language skills and learn academic content. Educators must cultivate an approach that integrates students' and their families' funds of knowledge into the classroom instructional practices. Culturally and linguistically sustaining practices leverage and celebrate students' cultural heritage and backgrounds while elevating their cultural and linguistic identities. Teaching and learning cognates that connect both (or multiple) languages can also construct bridges between languages and increase confidence as English language acquisition progresses.","01, 02, 03, KG",120
120.20.c.6,"The ELPS student expectations are the knowledge and skills students must demonstrate. They indicate what students should know and be able to do in order to meet academic content standards. Proficiency level descriptors describe behaviors EB students exhibit across five proficiency levels as they acquire English. EB students may exhibit different proficiency levels within and across the domains of listening, speaking, reading, and writing.","01, 02, 03, KG",120
120.20.c.7,"The ELPS demonstrate an asset-based approach to address the affective, linguistic, and cognitive needs of EB students in accordance with §89.1210(b) of this title (relating to Program Content and Design) as follows:","01, 02, 03, KG",120
120.20.c.8,"The proficiency level descriptors are organized into general proficiency level descriptors and content-area proficiency level descriptors. General proficiency level descriptors are descriptions of a broad scope of student behaviors that can be observed in a variety of educational settings and across content areas. Content-area proficiency level descriptors describe student behaviors and language associated with discipline-specific learning in English language arts and reading, mathematics, science, and social studies.","01, 02, 03, KG",120
120.20.c.7.A,"acknowledge and leverage the existing funds of knowledge students possess, including linguistic repertoire, cultural heritage, and background knowledge;","01, 02, 03, KG",120
120.20.c.7.B,"demonstrate targeted and intentional academic language skills to ensure content-area teachers are able to accurately evaluate the abilities of EB students and scaffold toward the increasingly complex English that students hear, speak, and are expected to read and write; and","01, 02, 03, KG",120
120.20.c.7.C,provide an exact and incremental measure of the stages of English language acquisition with attention to the fact that EB students at all levels of proficiency can engage in cognitively demanding tasks and master the required essential knowledge and skills with appropriate language support.,"01, 02, 03, KG",120
120.20.d.1,"Student expectations--listening. The EB student listens to a variety of speakers, including teachers, peers, and multimedia, to gain an increasing level of comprehension in all content areas. The EB student may be at the pre-production, beginning, intermediate, high intermediate, or advanced proficiency levels in listening. The student is expected to:","01, 02, 03, KG",120

The EB student speaks using a variety of language structures for a variety of purposes with an awareness of different language registers (formal/informal) using vocabulary with increasing accuracy and fluency in all content areas.

120.20.e.1.A,"Pre-production. The pre-production level, also known as the silent period, is the early stage of English language acquisition when receptive language is developing. Students develop comprehension when highly scaffolded instruction and linguistic support are provided. Student responses are mostly non-verbal.","01, 02, 03, KG",120
120.20.e.1.B,Beginning. The beginning level is characterized by speech emergence (expressive language) using one word or two-to-three-word phrases. Students at this level require highly scaffolded instruction and linguistic support. Students at this level begin to consistently use present tense verbs and repeat keywords and familiar phrases when engaging in formal and informal interactions.,"01, 02, 03, KG",120
120.20.e.1.C,"Intermediate. The intermediate level is characterized by the ability to use receptive and expressive language with demonstrated literal comprehension. Students at this level need moderately scaffolded instruction and linguistic support.

120.21.c.1,"The English language proficiency standards (ELPS) outline student expectations and proficiency level descriptors for EB students in English. The ELPS are organized across four language domains: listening, speaking, reading, and writing.","04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12",120
120.21.c.2,"Language acquisition is a complex process that consists of several interrelated components, including phonetics, phonology, semantics, syntax, morphology, and pragmatics. As students develop proficiency in these language structures, they are able to make connections between their primary language and English.","04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12",120
120.21.c.3,"Classroom contexts foster social and academic registers, which are types of language appropriate for a situation or setting, to support language proficiency. Informal (social) language consists of English needed for students to effectively interact, exchange ideas, and engage in various settings and contexts. Formal (academic) language consists of oral and written language used to build knowledge, participate in content-specific discourse, and process complex academic material found in formal school settings and interactions.","04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12",120
120.21.c.4,"The progression of skills in the four language domains are developed simultaneously and can be divided into two categories: receptive skills and expressive skills. Listening and reading are the receptive (input) skills. Students' development in receptive skills is necessary for comprehension and attainment of the English language and content. Speaking and writing are the expressive (output) skills. Students' ability to express and share their personal ideas and content knowledge allow teachers the opportunity to check for understanding and adjust instruction. Effective content-based language instruction involves engaging EB students in scaffolded opportunities to listen, speak, read, and write at their current levels of proficiency while gradually increasing linguistic complexity.","04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12",120
120.21.c.5,"In order for EB students to be successful, educators must create an environment that welcomes and encourages students to leverage their unique cultural and linguistic experiences as they develop English language skills and learn academic content. Educators must cultivate an approach that integrates students' and their families' funds of knowledge into the classroom instructional practices. Culturally and linguistically sustaining practices leverage and celebrate students' cultural heritage and backgrounds while elevating their cultural and linguistic identities. Teaching and learning cognates that connect both (or multiple) languages can also construct bridges between languages and increase confidence as English language acquisition progresses.","04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12",120
120.21.c.6,"The ELPS student expectations are the knowledge and skills students must demonstrate. They indicate what students should know and be able to do in order to meet academic content standards.
