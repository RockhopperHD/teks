116.12.a.1,"Physical education is the foundation of a well-balanced curriculum. ""It is an academic subject with a planned and sequential K-12 curriculum based on the national standards for physical education. Physical education provides cognitive content and instruction designed to develop motor skills, knowledge, and behaviors for physical activity and physical fitness. Supporting schools to establish daily physical education can provide students with the ability and confidence to be physically active for a lifetime"" (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CDC Healthy Schools, May 2019).",K,116
116.12.a.2,"The physical education standards are categorized into five strands that are of equal importance and value. The movement patterns and movement skills strand guides the physically literate student in the development of fundamental movement patterns, spatial and body awareness, and rhythmic activities. The performance strategies strand guides the physically literate student in utilizing strategies in fundamental components of games, activities, and outdoor and recreational pursuits. The health, physical activity, and fitness strand encompasses health-related fitness, environmental awareness, and safety practices that guide students to a health-enhancing, physically active lifestyle. The physically literate student demonstrates skills and mechanics used during physical activity and analyzes data used during fitness performance. The physically literate student recognizes the correlation between nutrition, hydration, and physical activity. The social and emotional health strand incorporates working with others, responding to class expectations, and applying self-management skills. The lifetime wellness strand engages students in physical activity for the purposes of self-expression, enjoyment, and challenge.",K,116
116.12.a.3,"Quality physical education programs include a comprehensive curriculum, physical activity, safety policies, safe environments, qualified physical education specialists instructing the class, and student assessment and do not use physical activity as a form of punishment. Texas state law outlines state requirements that support these essential components. In accordance with state law, physical education curriculum and instruction must be sequential, developmentally appropriate, and designed to meet the needs of all students, including students with disabilities and of all physical ability levels. At least 50% of the physical education class must be used for actual student physical activity at a moderate or vigorous intensity level, which aligns with additional state requirements for a minimum number of minutes for moderate or vigorous physical activity in Kindergarten-Grade 8. Required student-to-teacher ratios of 45-to-1 ensure the proper supervision and safety of students in physical education classes, and school districts must identify how student safety will be maintained if that ratio is exceeded. State law also requires that school districts and charter schools annually assess the physical fitness of students in Grade 3or higher who are enrolled in a physical education course.",K,116
116.12.a.4,"Access to age-appropriate physical education equipment is essential to quality instruction. Basic, age-appropriate equipment for all students is imperative for the development of motor skills, manipulative skills, and eventually becoming a physically literate lifelong learner. Without basic, age-appropriate equipment, students will not have the necessary experiences to become physically literate, lifelong learners. All equipment should be age appropriate for the grade levels to be taught. The term ""age appropriate"" means that the equipment must include a variety of sizes, weights, and textures to provide differentiated experiences for various ages and ability levels of students. Basic equipment for quality instruction includes, but is not limited to, the following list: sports balls, including fleece balls, foam balls, tennis balls, beach balls, volleyballs, basketballs, soccer balls, footballs, baseballs, softballs, and unity balls; striking implements, including golf clubs, hockey sticks, baseball bats, pool noodles, tennis rackets, racquetball rackets, pickleball paddles, lollipop paddles, and ping pong paddles; goals for various sports, including soccer goals and basketball goals; nets and standards for a variety of sports, including volleyball, pickleball, badminton, and tennis; fitness-related equipment; other basic equipment, including scarves, bean bags, hula hoops, jump ropes, and scooters; classroom management equipment, including cones, mats, pinnies, poly spots, and ball inflators; and technology, including microphones, projectors, speakers, heart rate monitors, timers, and other technology appropriate for instruction.",K,116
