## Quiz (Base & Open Question)
In Quiz, learners answer a series of questions derived from the reading material, designed to test their comprehension and recall. This activity has two primary modes:

Multiple Choice (Base): Learners select the correct answer(s) from a list of options provided for a question.

Open Question: Learners input their own short or medium-length written response into a text field.

The results from both modes are typically recorded, with open-ended answers often requiring manual review by an instructor.

Quiz is great for content material like verifying factual recall, assessing reading comprehension, and encouraging learners to articulate specific details or concepts from the text.
*Ideally, the program can suggest a "quiz" and then, on top of that in a tag or hover effect or something, suggest what kind of quiz.*

## True/False
In True/False, learners evaluate a series of statements derived from the text to determine if they accurately reflect the information presented or if they contain false or modified details.

True/False is great for content material like fact-checking, distinguishing between similar concepts, and verifying close attention to detail in a reading.

## Fill-in-the-gaps
In Fill-in-the-gaps, learners complete sentences or paragraphs by selecting or identifying key terms—such as nouns or adjectives—that have been removed from the text context.

Fill-in-the-gaps is great for content material like vocabulary reinforcement, grammar structure practice, and understanding context clues within a sentence.

## Relations
In Relations, learners draw logical connections between pairs of items, such as matching words to their definitions or linking semantically related concepts found in the reading (one-to-one relationships).

Relations is great for content material like synonym/antonym practice, vocabulary building, and reinforcing specific terminology or concept associations.

## Spot the Intruder
In Spot the Intruder, learners analyze a group of words related to the text to identify the single term that does not belong to the specific semantic category or theme shared by the others.

Spot the Intruder is great for content material like taxonomic categorization, logical reasoning, and differentiating between closely related themes or attributes.

## Choose the Best Summary
In Choose the Best Summary, learners evaluate three potential summaries of a text to select the one that most accurately and completely reflects the main ideas, avoiding options with errors or irrelevant details.

Choose the Best Summary is great for content material like reading comprehension synthesis, identifying main ideas versus supporting details, and practicing summarization skills.

## Write Your Summary
In Write Your Summary, learners practice synthesis and expression by drafting their own original synopsis of the reading, often including a creative title.

Write Your Summary is great for content material like creative writing, advanced comprehension assessment, and encouraging learners to express information in their own voice.

## Word Search
In Word Search, learners scan a grid of letters to locate and select specific key terms hidden vertically or horizontally that are relevant to the reading material.

Word Search is great for content material like visual scanning, spelling reinforcement, and familiarizing learners with key vocabulary in a low-stress environment.

## Crossword
In Crossword, learners use brief definitions based on the text to figure out specific words and fit them into an interlocking grid structure.

Crossword is great for content material like testing definitions, recalling specific terminology, and combining logic with vocabulary recall.

## Memory
In Memory, learners flip virtual cards to find and match pairs of related concepts or words derived from the text, relying on recall and concentration.

Memory is great for content material like vocabulary retention, visual memory training, and gamified reinforcement of simple concept associations.
